= Smart Home Arduino App

This project is a Smart Home Arduino application designed to monitor the internal room temperature using a sensor connected to the Arduino and fetch the external temperature via a weather API. Additionally, the project incorporates sleep data analysis to evaluate the relationship between indoor/outdoor temperatures and sleep quality. It provides actionable insights into energy consumption patterns, helping to determine cost-efficient appliance usage times and optimal sleeping conditions.

== Features

- **Internal Temperature Monitoring**: Uses a DS18B20 sensor to read the room temperature.
- **External Weather API Integration**: Fetches real-time external temperature using OpenWeather API.
- **Electricity Tariff Optimization**: Connects to the Octopus Energy tariff API for cost-efficient energy consumption.
- **Sleep Analysis**: Correlates indoor and outdoor temperature data with sleep patterns to identify optimal sleeping conditions.
- **Energy Consumption Analysis**: Analyzes energy consumption patterns and identifies cost-efficient times to use household appliances based on electricity tariffs.

== Step 1: Installation

Follow these steps to install this project:

. Clone the repository:
+
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/osamaalshu/smartHomeArduino.git
----

. Install the required Arduino libraries:
+
- `WiFiNINA` (for API integration)
- `OneWire` and `DallasTemperature` (for the DS18B20 sensor)

. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided `.ino` file.

== Step 2: Assemble the Circuit

Assemble the circuit following the `layout.png` provided in the repository. For this setup:

- Connect the DS18B20 sensor to the breadboard.
- Wire the sensor as follows:
- **VCC** to 3.3V on the Arduino.
- **GND** to ground.
- **DATA** to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) with a 4.7k pull-up resistor.
- Secure the sensor in place near the bedside table for consistent readings.

== Step 3: Load the Code

1. Open the `sketch.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Configure the `arduino_secrets.h` file with your Wi-Fi and API credentials:
```cpp
#define SECRET_SSID "YourWiFiSSID"
#define SECRET_PASS "YourWiFiPassword"
#define WEATHER_API_KEY "YourOpenWeatherAPIKey"
#define TARIFF_API_KEY "YourOctopusAPIKey"
```
3.Select the appropriate board and COM port in the Arduino IDE.
4.Upload the code to your Arduino board.
